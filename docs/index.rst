Welcome to SymNum's documentation!
==================================

SymNum is a Python package that acts a bridge between NumPy and SymPy, providing a
NumPy-like interface that can be used to symbolically define functions which take arrays
as arguments and return arrays or scalars as values. A series of Autograd style
functional differential operators are also provided to construct derivatives of symbolic
functions, with the option to generate NumPy code to numerically evaluate these
derivative functions.
